### Hi there! 👋
I'm passionate about continuous learning📚, and developing my professional skills🤓. I thrive on achieving certifications🏆 and honing my expertise in various domains. When I'm not immersed in learning, you'll find me indulging in my other passions, including running🏃, karting🏁, climbing🧗, trampoline jumping, and dancing🕺. I'm also an avid fan of Formula 1🏎️, gaming🎮, and all things tech📱.

Here's a snapshot of my current focus:

🌱 Currently, I'm expanding my knowledge in GitHub, Terraform, Docker, Linux, and AWS.
🤝 I'm actively seeking opportunities to collaborate on projects related to DevOps and Test Automation.
📫 Reach out to me via LinkedIn for any inquiries or professional connections.
⚡ Fun fact: I'm a unique blend of a DevOps enthusiast and an AQA engineer, bringing the best of both worlds to my work.
Feel free to explore my repositories and get in touch. Let's connect and make a positive impact in the world of technology together!
